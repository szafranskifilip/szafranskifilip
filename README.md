### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist specilizing in **Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning**. Currently living and working in New York, but I'm willing to relocate or accept a remote position.

Check out my last project -[Bitcoin sentiment analysis and its impact on the price change](https://github.com/szafranskifilip/bitcoin_sentiment_analysis).

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving. So far I have Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Matplotlib&Seaborn, Requests, Beautiful Soup, scikit-learn, Keras, natural language processing, deep learning, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I've started learning, MongoDB, Django, and Google Studio.. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.

A big enthusiast of solving business problems with sentiment analysis.
